# Introduction

In the realm of computer programming, each language possesses its unique methodology for the formatting of dates and times. For instance, languages such as C and Python employ `strftime` and `strptime`, Go utilizes a format predicated on actual dates, whereas others like C# and Java adopt custom case sensitive format specifiers. The absence of a universal standard for date and time formatting across diverse programming languages engenders challenges in memorizing the format specifiers pertinent to each language.

The establishment of a standardized date format specifier across programming languages is a critical prerequisite for ensuring consistency and interoperability amidst various systems and applications. The Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) initiative endeavors to standardize date and time formatting in a manner that transcends the boundaries of individual programming languages. This case-insensitive format eradicates ambiguity, thereby simplifying the process of memorization and input. By advocating for user-friendly formats such as `yyyy-mm-dd`, the IDFS initiative fosters simplicity and hackability in the realm of date-time formatting.

The IDFS format accommodates a broad spectrum of date and time formats, encompassing two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with or without leading zeros, ordinal formats, abbreviated and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations. Furthermore, IDFS supports timezone offsets with or without leading zeros and colons.

# Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to define a set of Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) that provide a standardized, cross-platform approach to formatting dates and times in programming languages. The IDFS aims to simplify date and time handling by offering a set of format specifiers that are intuitive, easy to remember, and consistent across different programming languages. By establishing a common set of date and time format specifiers, the IDFS seeks to improve the readability, maintainability, and interoperability of date and time-related code.

# Scope

The scope of the IDFS specification includes the following key aspects:

1. **Standardization Across Programming Languages:** The IDFS will define a set of format specifiers for formatting dates and times that can be universally understood and implemented across various programming languages. This standardization aims to reduce the complexity and ambiguity associated with existing date and time formatting systems.

2. **Consistency:** By promoting a standardized set of format specifiers, the IDFS seeks to improve consistency in date and time formatting across different programming languages and environments. This consistency will make it easier for developers to work with date and time data in a consistent manner.

3. **Interoperability:** The IDFS will facilitate interoperability between different systems and applications that handle date and time information. By using a common set of format specifiers, the IDFS will help ensure that date and time data can be exchanged and processed correctly across different platforms and programming languages.

4. **User-Friendly Formats:** The IDFS will prioritize user-friendly date and time formats that are easy to read, write, and remember. Formats such as `yyyy-mm-dd` for dates and `hh:mm:ss` for times will be emphasized to enhance readability and usability. Furthermore, the IDFS will be case-insensitive and hackable, making it easier for developers to work with date and time data.

5. **Comprehensive Support:** The IDFS will support a wide range of date and time formats, including two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with or without leading zeros, ordinal formats, abbreviated and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations.

6. **Ease of Adoption:** The IDFS specification will be designed to be easy to adopt by developers, with clear documentation and examples provided for each format specifier.

7. **Backward Compatibility:** Where possible, IDFS will strive to maintain backward compatibility with existing date and time formatting systems, ensuring a smooth transition for developers.

By defining a standardized set of Intuitive Date Format Specifiers, this specification aims to simplify date and time handling in software development, improve consistency and interoperability, and enhance the overall user experience when working with dates and times.

# Background

In the landscape of software development, the representation and manipulation of dates and times are foundational tasks. However, the approaches to date and time formatting vary significantly across programming languages, leading to confusion and complexity for developers. For example:

- **C and Python** use the `strftime` and `strptime` functions, which require developers to use different format specifiers (`%Y`, `%m`, `%d`, `%H`, `%M`, `%S`, etc.) to represent various parts of a date or time.

- **Go** uses a unique approach where the date formatting is based on a reference date (`Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006`), requiring developers to use specific values from this reference date to format dates.

- **C# and Java** utilize custom format specifiers (`yyyy`, `MM`, `dd`, `HH`, `mm`, `ss`, etc.) that are case sensitive and can differ between the two languages.

The lack of a universal standard for date and time formatting across programming languages poses several challenges:

- **Learning Curve:** Developers must learn and remember different format specifiers for each programming language they work with, increasing the learning curve and potential for errors.

- **Maintenance Complexity:** In projects involving multiple programming languages, maintaining consistent date and time formatting can be challenging, requiring developers to refer back to documentation or existing code.

- **Integration Challenges:** Integrating systems written in different languages often requires complex conversion logic to ensure that date and time information is accurately represented.

- **Internationalization Challenges:** Date and time formatting becomes even more challenging in international contexts, where different countries and cultures have varying conventions for representing dates and times. Developers must consider factors such as language, locale, and calendar systems when handling date and time data.

- **Interoperability Issues:** In projects that involve multiple programming languages or systems, interoperability becomes a significant concern. Mismatched date and time formats can lead to errors and inconsistencies when exchanging data between different systems.

- **Error-Prone:** Small mistakes in format specifiers, such as using `%m` for minutes instead of `%M`, can lead to significant errors in date and time parsing.

The Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) initiative seeks to address these challenges by defining a standardized set of format specifiers that are intuitive, easy to remember, and consistent across programming languages. By promoting simplicity and consistency in date and time formatting, IDFS aims to improve the developer experience and reduce errors in date and time handling.

| `oo`   | `±0700` | Timezone offset with leading zero without colon    |
| `ooo`  | `±07:00`| Timezone offset with leading zero with colon       |

## The conventions followed by IDFS specifiers design

- When a `single character specifier` is used, it is without leading zero or padding. For example, `y`, `m`, `d`, `h`, `i`, `s` represent year, month, day, hour, minute, and second without leading zero or padding respectively.
- When `two characters of same family (consicutively)` are used, they are padded with leading zeros. For example, `yy`, `mm`, `dd`, `hh`, `ii`, `ss` represent two-digit year, month, day, hour, minute, and second with leading zeros respectively.
- When `b suffix` is used, it is blank-padded with leading zeros. For example, `yb`, `mb`, `db` represent two-digit year, month, and day with leading space padding respectively.
