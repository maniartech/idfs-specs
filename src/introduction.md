## Introduction

Standardizing date format specifiers is essential for ensuring consistency and accuracy in data processing and communication. The Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) aims to standardize date and time formatting in programming language independent way. This cAsE-insensitive format eliminates ambiguity, making it easier to remember and input. By using human-friendly formats like yyyy-mm-dd, IDFS promotes simplicity and accessibility in date-time formatting.

The IDFS format supports a wide range of date and time formats, including two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with and without leading zeros, ordinal formats, short and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations. IDFS also supports timezone offsets with and without leading zeros and colons.

By utilizing time.Time.Format() and converting human-friendly formats into the time.Time format, IDFS ensures compatibility and interoperability between different systems and applications. This paper aims to explore the benefits and applications of IDFS, its impact on data interoperability, and best practices for implementing standardized date format specifiers in programming languages.
