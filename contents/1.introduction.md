# Introduction

In the realm of computer programming, each language possesses its unique methodology for the formatting of dates and times. For instance, languages such as C and Python employ `strftime` and `strptime`, Go utilizes a format predicated on actual dates, whereas others like C# and Java adopt custom case sensitive format specifiers. The absence of a universal standard for date and time formatting across diverse programming languages engenders challenges in memorizing the format specifiers pertinent to each language.

The establishment of a standardized date format specifier across programming languages is a critical prerequisite for ensuring consistency and interoperability amidst various systems and applications. The Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) initiative endeavors to standardize date and time formatting in a manner that transcends the boundaries of individual programming languages. This case-insensitive format eradicates ambiguity, thereby simplifying the process of memorization and input. By advocating for user-friendly formats such as `yyyy-mm-dd`, the IDFS initiative fosters simplicity and hackability in the realm of date-time formatting.

The IDFS format accommodates a broad spectrum of date and time formats, encompassing two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with or without leading zeros, ordinal formats, abbreviated and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations. Furthermore, IDFS supports timezone offsets with or without leading zeros and colons.

### Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to define a set of Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) that provide a standardized, cross-platform approach to formatting dates and times in programming languages. The IDFS aims to simplify date and time handling by offering a set of format specifiers that are intuitive, easy to remember, and consistent across different programming languages. By establishing a common set of date and time format specifiers, the IDFS seeks to improve the readability, maintainability, and interoperability of date and time-related code.

### Scope

The scope of the IDFS specification includes the following key aspects:

1. **Standardization Across Programming Languages:** The IDFS will define a set of format specifiers for formatting dates and times that can be universally understood and implemented across various programming languages. This standardization aims to reduce the complexity and ambiguity associated with existing date and time formatting systems.

2. **Consistency:** By promoting a standardized set of format specifiers, the IDFS seeks to improve consistency in date and time formatting across different programming languages and environments. This consistency will make it easier for developers to work with date and time data in a consistent manner.

3. **Interoperability:** The IDFS will facilitate interoperability between different systems and applications that handle date and time information. By using a common set of format specifiers, the IDFS will help ensure that date and time data can be exchanged and processed correctly across different platforms and programming languages.

4. **User-Friendly Formats:** The IDFS will prioritize user-friendly date and time formats that are easy to read, write, and remember. Formats such as `yyyy-mm-dd` for dates and `hh:mm:ss` for times will be emphasized to enhance readability and usability. Furthermore, the IDFS will be case-insensitive and hackable, making it easier for developers to work with date and time data.

5. **Comprehensive Support:** The IDFS will support a wide range of date and time formats, including two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with or without leading zeros, ordinal formats, abbreviated and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations.

6. **Ease of Adoption:** The IDFS specification will be designed to be easy to adopt by developers, with clear documentation and examples provided for each format specifier.

7. **Backward Compatibility:** Where possible, IDFS will strive to maintain backward compatibility with existing date and time formatting systems, ensuring a smooth transition for developers.

By defining a standardized set of Intuitive Date Format Specifiers, this specification aims to simplify date and time handling in software development, improve consistency and interoperability, and enhance the overall user experience when working with dates and times.
