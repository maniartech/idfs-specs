## The conventions followed by IDFS specifiers design

- When a `single character specifier` is used, it is without leading zero or padding. For example, `y`, `m`, `d`, `h`, `i`, `s` represent year, month, day, hour, minute, and second without leading zero or padding respectively.
- When `two characters of same family (consicutively)` are used, they are padded with leading zeros. For example, `yy`, `mm`, `dd`, `hh`, `ii`, `ss` represent two-digit year, month, day, hour, minute, and second with leading zeros respectively.
- When `b suffix` is used, it is blank-padded with leading zeros. For example, `yb`, `mb`, `db` represent two-digit year, month, and day with leading space padding respectively.
