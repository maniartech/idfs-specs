## Scope

The Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) initiative aims to establish a standardized, cross-platform specification for formatting dates and times in a user-friendly, intuitive manner. The scope of the IDFS specification includes:

1. **Standardization Across Programming Languages:** IDFS will define a set of format specifiers that can be universally understood and implemented across various programming languages, including but not limited to C, Python, Java, Go, and C#.

2. **Consistency and Interoperability:** By promoting a standardized format, IDFS aims to improve consistency and interoperability between different systems and applications that handle date and time information.

3. **User-Friendly Formats:** IDFS will prioritize user-friendly formats that are easy to read, write, and remember. Formats like `yyyy-mm-dd` for dates and `hh:mm:ss` for times will be emphasized.

4. **Comprehensive Date and Time Formats:** IDFS will support a wide range of date and time formats, including two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with or without leading zeros, ordinal formats, abbreviated and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations.

5. **Timezone Support:** IDFS will support timezone offsets with or without leading zeros and colons, allowing for accurate representation of dates and times across different timezones.

6. **Ease of Adoption:** The IDFS specification will be designed to be easy to adopt by developers, with clear documentation and examples provided for each format specifier.

7. **Backward Compatibility:** Where possible, IDFS will strive to maintain backward compatibility with existing date and time formatting systems, ensuring a smooth transition for developers.

By defining a standardized set of date and time format specifiers, the IDFS initiative aims to simplify date and time handling in software development, reduce errors, and improve the overall user experience when working with dates and times.
