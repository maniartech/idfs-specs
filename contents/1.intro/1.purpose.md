## Purpose

The purpose of this specification is to define a set of Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) that provide a standardized, cross-platform approach to formatting dates and times in programming languages. The IDFS aims to simplify date and time handling by offering a set of format specifiers that are intuitive, easy to remember, and consistent across different programming languages. By establishing a common set of date and time format specifiers, the IDFS seeks to improve the readability, maintainability, and interoperability of date and time-related code.
