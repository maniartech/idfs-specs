# Purpose

The primary purpose of the Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) is to introduce a standardized, intuitive, hackable, and universally adoptable set of format specifiers for date and time across programming languages. This initiative aims to bridge the gap created by the diverse formatting systems that currently exist across different programming environments, reducing the learning curve and minimizing the scope for errors.

Specific objectives of the IDFS include:

1. **Standardization**: To provide a consistent approach to date and time formatting that can be easily implemented across various programming languages and platforms. This standardization seeks to eliminate the inconsistencies that currently complicate the development and maintenance of software systems.

2. **Simplicity and Intuitiveness**: To design format specifiers that are logical and easy to remember, thereby reducing the time developers spend referencing documentation and debugging related errors. The simplicity of IDFS is intended to enhance productivity and allow developers to focus more on core software functionality rather than the intricacies of date and time formatting.

3. **Interoperability**: To facilitate better data exchange and system integration by ensuring that date and time information conforms to a universally understood format. This is particularly crucial in distributed systems where applications and services interact across different technological stacks and time zones.

4. **Enhanced Usability and Accessibility**: To make date and time formatting more approachable for new programmers and those from non-traditional backgrounds by removing complex syntax barriers. This inclusivity supports broader participation in programming and software development.

5. **Error Reduction**: To minimize common errors associated with date and time formatting by providing clear and unambiguous specifiers. This contributes to more reliable and robust software solutions.

Through these objectives, IDFS aims to fundamentally improve how dates and times are handled in software development, leading to more robust, maintainable, platform-independent, and user-friendly applications.
