# Introduction

In the realm of computer programming, each language possesses its unique methodology for the formatting of dates and times. For instance, languages such as C and Python employ `strftime` and `strptime`, Go utilizes a format predicated on actual dates, whereas others like C# and Java adopt custom case sensitive format specifiers. The absence of a universal standard for date and time formatting across diverse programming languages engenders challenges in memorizing the format specifiers pertinent to each language.

The establishment of a standardized date format specifier across programming languages is a critical prerequisite for ensuring consistency and interoperability amidst various systems and applications. The Intuitive Date Format Specifiers (IDFS) initiative endeavors to standardize date and time formatting in a manner that transcends the boundaries of individual programming languages. This case-insensitive format eradicates ambiguity, thereby simplifying the process of memorization and input. By advocating for user-friendly formats such as `yyyy-mm-dd`, the IDFS initiative fosters simplicity and hackability in the realm of date-time formatting.

The IDFS format accommodates a broad spectrum of date and time formats, encompassing two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with or without leading zeros, ordinal formats, abbreviated and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations. Furthermore, IDFS supports timezone offsets with or without leading zeros and colons.
