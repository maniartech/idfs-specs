## Scope

The scope of the IDFS specification includes the following key aspects:

1. **Standardization Across Programming Languages:** The IDFS will define a set of format specifiers for formatting dates and times that can be universally understood and implemented across various programming languages. This standardization aims to reduce the complexity and ambiguity associated with existing date and time formatting systems.

2. **Consistency:** By promoting a standardized set of format specifiers, the IDFS seeks to improve consistency in date and time formatting across different programming languages and environments. This consistency will make it easier for developers to work with date and time data in a consistent manner.

3. **Interoperability:** The IDFS will facilitate interoperability between different systems and applications that handle date and time information. By using a common set of format specifiers, the IDFS will help ensure that date and time data can be exchanged and processed correctly across different platforms and programming languages.

4. **User-Friendly Formats:** The IDFS will prioritize user-friendly date and time formats that are easy to read, write, and remember. Formats such as `yyyy-mm-dd` for dates and `hh:mm:ss` for times will be emphasized to enhance readability and usability. Furthermore, the IDFS will be case-insensitive and hackable, making it easier for developers to work with date and time data.

5. **Comprehensive Support:** The IDFS will support a wide range of date and time formats, including two-digit and four-digit years, month and day with or without leading zeros, ordinal formats, abbreviated and full month names, 12-hour and 24-hour formats, AM/PM indicators, microseconds, and timezone abbreviations.

6. **Ease of Adoption:** The IDFS specification will be designed to be easy to adopt by developers, with clear documentation and examples provided for each format specifier.

7. **Backward Compatibility:** Where possible, IDFS will strive to maintain backward compatibility with existing date and time formatting systems, ensuring a smooth transition for developers.

By defining a standardized set of Intuitive Date Format Specifiers, this specification aims to simplify date and time handling in software development, improve consistency and interoperability, and enhance the overall user experience when working with dates and times.
